# RISC-V ISA Semantics for Lean

This translation of the official [SAIL RISC-V
SPEC](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/) into the [Lean Theorem
Prover](https://lean-lang.org) covers the full RISC-V SPEC and passes the Lean
type-checkers without errors.

⚠️ However, our Lean backend for sail is still work-in-progress.  This means,
this resulting Lean code is neither executable nor polished in any way. ⚠️

## How to build this model

This repository generates automatically the RISC-V Lean model from the official Sail model. To generate it locally, follow the following steps.

### Build Sail

The released version of Sail does not support Lean output, so we need to build
Sail from its git repository. All the details are given in the [official
instructions](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/INSTALL.md#installing-development-versions-of-sail).
What follows here is a summary:

#### 1. Install `OCaml`'s opam using your package manager
#### 2. Install the depdencies

On Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgmp-dev z3 pkg-config
```
or on MacOS
```
brew install gmp z3 pkgconf
```

#### 3. Install sail
```
git clone https://github.com/rems-project/sail.git
```

Using opam:
```
opam pin add sail
```

With dune, inside the Sail root directory:
```
opam install . --deps-only
dune build --release
dune install
```

### Build the RISC-V model

To build the RISC-V model, first clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv.git
```

and then build it using the cmake:
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build/ --target generated_lean_rv64d
```

The resulting Lean model will be in `build/model/Lean_RV64D` and can be built using `lake build`

SAIL semantics in support of this project.
